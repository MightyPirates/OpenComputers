/**
 * Use this interface on environments provided by drivers for items that can

 * The provided environment can be used for updating the part in its installed
 * state. The nodes provided by the getters in this interface are used to
 * access nodes provided by the environment (e.g. multiple "interfacing"
 * nodes for a switch), and connect the nodes to the corresponding buses as
 * defined by the rack's configuration.
 * <p/>
 * Note: mountables may implement the {@link ComponentHost} interface and
 * {@link IInventory}. In this case, if they contain a redstone card and have
 * a state of <tt>State.IsWorking</tt> the rack will visually connect to
 * redstone, for example. Same goes for abstract bus cards, and potentially
 * more things in the future.
 * <p/>
 * Furthermore, implementing {@link Analyzable} will allow specifying more
 * information when the analyzer is used on the mountable while it's in a rack.
