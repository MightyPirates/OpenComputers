/**
 * Interface for interacting with networks.
 * <p/>
 * Computers and components form ad-hoc "networks" when placed next to each
 * other. They allow computers to communicate with the components attached to
 * them (and nodes amongst each other) by using the network as an index
 * structure.
 * <p/>
 * There are three types of nodes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Node}, the most basic form.</li>
 * <li>{@link Component}, used to expose callbacks to user code.</li>
 * <li>{@link Connector}, used for consuming of producing energy.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * See <tt>Node</tt> for more details on the behavior of single nodes, and in
 * particular how nodes represented by tile entities should be added.
 * <p/>
 * Another important concept of node networks is reachability and visibility,
 * see {@link Visibility}.
 * <p/>
 * Note that network access in general is <em>not</em> thread safe! Networks
 * should only be accessed from the main server thread. The exception are the
 * connector nodes, which can be used to consume or produce energy from other
 * threads.
 * <p/>
 * IMPORTANT: do *not* implement this interface yourself and create
 * instances of your own network implementation; this will lead to
 * incompatibilities with the built-in network implementation (which can only
 * merge with other networks of its own type). Always use the methods provided
 * in {@link li.cil.oc.api.Network} to create and join networks.
