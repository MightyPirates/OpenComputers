 * Server racks <em>do not</em> serve as environment for the computer nodes of
 * servers. That's what the {@link li.cil.oc.api.internal.Server}s are for,
 * which are mountables that can be placed in the rack.
 * <p/>
 * Another purpose is to allow identifying tile entities as racks via the API,
 * i.e. without having to link against internal classes. This also means that
 * <em>you should not implement this</em>.
