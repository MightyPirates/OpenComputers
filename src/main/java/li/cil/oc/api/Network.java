/**
 * This class provides factories for networks and nodes.
 * <p/>
 * The first two functions provided provided by this API are to allow existing
 * environments - implemented in a tile entity for example - to join an existing
 * network or create new ones. The third one is used to create nodes that may
 * then be connected to an existing network. It is not possible to create
 * networks that do not belong to at least one tile entity or node.
 * <p/>
 * It is important to understand that component networks only exist on the
 * server side. It is impossible to create nodes, and therefore networks, on
 * the client side. This is to enforce a clear distinction of where the actual
 * logic lies - since user code only runs on the server.
 * <p/>
 * Note that these methods should <em>not</em> be called in the pre-init phase,
 * since the {@link li.cil.oc.api.API#network} may not have been initialized
 * at that time. Only start calling these methods in the init phase or later.
