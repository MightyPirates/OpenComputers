/**
 * Interface for item component drivers.
 * <p/>
 * This driver type is used for components that are items, i.e. that can be
 * inserted into computers and robots. An example for this are internal drives,
 * memory and graphic cards.
 * <p/>
 * When trying to add an item to a computer the list of registered drivers is
 * queried using the drivers' <tt>worksWith</tt> functions. The first driver
 * that replies positively and whose check against the slot type is successful,
 * i.e. for which the <tt>slot</tt> matches the slot it should be inserted into,
 * will be used as the component's driver and the component will be added. If no
 * driver is found the item will be rejected and cannot be installed.
 * <p/>
 * Note that it is possible to write one driver that supports as many different
 * items as you wish. I'd recommend writing one per device (type), though, to
 * keep things modular.
