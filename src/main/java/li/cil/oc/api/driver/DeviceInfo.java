 * Implement this on {@link li.cil.oc.api.network.Environment}s if you wish to
 * expose some (typically static) information about the device represented by
 * that environment to a {@link li.cil.oc.api.Machine} connected to it.
 * <p/>
 * You may also implement this on a {@link li.cil.oc.api.machine.MachineHost}
 * in which case the <code>Machine</code> will forward that information as
 * its own (since <code>MachineHost</code>s usually use the machine's node as
 * their own, this avoids a dummy environment used solely for device info).
 * <p/>
 * This is intended to permit programs to reflect on the hardware they are
 * running on, typically for purely informational purposes, but possibly to
 * toggle certain hardware specific features.
 * <p/>
 * For example, graphics cards may expose their timings via this interface, so
 * that programs may determine at what speed they can redraw, and optimize
 * execution order.
 * <p/>
 * While the format of the returned table of information is entirely up to you,
 * it is recommended to orient yourself on the key values and names that
 * <code>lshw</code> uses (http://www.ezix.org/project/wiki/HardwareLiSter),
 * where applicable.
