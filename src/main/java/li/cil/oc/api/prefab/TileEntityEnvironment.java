     *       // If you do not need energy remove this call.
     *       .withConnector()
     *       // This call marks the tile entity as a component. This means you
     *       // can mark methods in it using the {@link li.cil.oc.api.machine.Callback}
     *       // annotation, making them callable from user code. The first

     *       // the computer, in this case it could be accessed as
     *       // <tt>component.example</tt>. The second parameter is the
     *       // component's visibility. This is like the node's reachability,
     *       // but only applies to computers. For example, network cards can
     *       // only be <em>seen</em> by the computer they're installed in, but
     *       // can be <em>reached</em> by all other network cards in the same
     *       // network. If you do not need callbacks remove this call.
     *       .withComponent("example", Visibility.Neighbors)
     *       // Finalizes the construction of the node and returns it.
     *       .create();
