/**
 * Subclass of {@link Varargs} that represents a lua tail call 
 * in a Java library function execution environment. 
 * <p>
 * Since Java doesn't have direct support for tail calls, 
 * any lua function whose {@link Prototype} contains the 
 * {@link Lua#OP_TAILCALL} bytecode needs a mechanism 
 * for tail calls when converting lua-bytecode to java-bytecode.
 * <p>
 * The tail call holds the next function and arguments, 
 * and the client a call to {@link #eval()} executes the function
 * repeatedly until the tail calls are completed. 
 * <p>
 * Normally, users of luaj need not concern themselves with the 
 * details of this mechanism, as it is built into the core 
 * execution framework. 
 * @see Prototype 
 * @see LuaJC
