/** 
 * Subclass of {@link BaseLib} and {@link LibFunction} which implements the lua basic library functions
 * and provides a directory based {@link ResourceFinder} as the {@link #FINDER}. 
 * <p>
 * Since JME has no file system by default, {@link BaseLib} implements 
 * {@link ResourceFinder} using {@link Class#getResource(String)}. 
 * The {@link JseBaseLib} implements {@link FINDER} by scanning the current directory
 * first, then falling back to   {@link Class#getResource(String)} if that fails.
 * Otherwise, the behavior is the same as that of {@link BaseLib}.  
 * <p>  
 * Typically, this library is included as part of a call to 
 * {@link JsePlatform#standardGlobals()}
 * <pre> {@code
 * Globals globals = JsePlatform.standardGlobals();
 * globals.get("print").call(LuaValue.valueOf("hello, world"));
 * } </pre>
 * <p>
 * For special cases where the smallest possible footprint is desired, 
 * a minimal set of libraries could be loaded
 * directly via {@link Globals#load(LuaValue)} using code such as:
 * <pre> {@code
 * Globals globals = new Globals();
 * globals.load(new JseBaseLib());
 * globals.get("print").call(LuaValue.valueOf("hello, world"));
 * } </pre>
 * <p>However, other libraries such as <em>PackageLib</em> are not loaded in this case.
 * <p>
 * This is a direct port of the corresponding library in C.
