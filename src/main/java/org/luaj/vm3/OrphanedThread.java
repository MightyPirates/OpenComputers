 * <p>
 * The java thread in which this is thrown should correspond to a
 * {@link LuaThread} being used as a coroutine that could not possibly be
 * resumed again because there are no more references to the LuaThread with
 * which it is associated. Rather than locking up resources forever, this error
 * is thrown, and should fall through all the way to the thread's {@link Thread.run}() method.
 * <p>
 * Java code mixed with the luaj vm should not catch this error because it may
 * occur when the coroutine is not running, so any processing done during error
 * handling could break the thread-safety of the application because other lua
 * processing could be going on in a different thread.
