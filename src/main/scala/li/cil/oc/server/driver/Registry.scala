/**
 * This class keeps track of registered drivers and provides installation logic
 * for each registered driver.
 *
 * Each component type must register its driver with this class to be used with
 * computers, since this class is used to determine whether an object is a
 * valid component or not.
 *
 * All drivers must be installed once the game starts - in the init phase - and
 * are then injected into all computers started up past that point. A driver is
 * a set of functions made available to the computer. These functions will
 * usually require a component of the type the driver wraps to be installed in
 * the computer, but may also provide context-free functions.
