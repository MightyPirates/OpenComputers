# This a list of names that robots are randomly named after, unless
# explicitly named using an anvil.
# If your name is on this list and you'd rather it not be, or you'd like a
# different alias, sorry! Please make a pull request with the changed list.
# Names of more or less famous robots and AIs, are welcome. Feel free to add
# more via pull requests. Let's hope this won't get us sued...

# When adding names, please keep the list sorted alphabetically, make sure it's
# not already in the list, and, where appropriate, provide a concise source.
# And since we now also have that special case, ignore special characters when
# sorting.
