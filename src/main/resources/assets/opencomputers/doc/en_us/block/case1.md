# Computer Case

![Just in case.](oredict:opencomputers:case1)

Computer cases come in three different tiers, which limits the components that can be inserted into them. An additional tier also exists for use in creative mode only. Computer cases can also be placed inside an [assembler](assembler.md) to build [robots](robot.md).

The maximum tier of the component that can be inserted into any slot of a computer case can be seen as a small roman numeral in the corner of a tier-limited slot. A tier 2 slot can take a tier 1 component, for instance. 

The tier 1 case can house up to and including the following components:
- 2x tier 1 expansion cards (such as [graphics cards](../item/graphicsCard1.md), [network cards](../item/lanCard.md), etc)
- 1x tier 1 [CPU](../item/cpu1.md)
- 2x tier 1 [RAM](../item/ram1.md)
- 1x tier 1 [HDD](../item/hdd1.md)

The tier 2 case can house up to and including the following components:
- 1x tier 1 Expansion card (such as [graphics cards](../item/graphicsCard1.md), [network cards](../item/lanCard.md), etc)
- 1x tier 2 Expansion card
- 1x tier 2 [CPU](../item/cpu2.md)
- 2x tier 2 [RAM](../item/ram3.md)
- 1x tier 1 [HDD](../item/hdd1.md)
- 1x tier 2 [HDD](../item/hdd2.md)

The tier 3 case can house up to and including the following components:
- 1x tier 3 Expansion card (such as [graphics cards](../item/graphicsCard1.md), [network cards](../item/lanCard.md), etc)
- 2x tier 2 Expansion card
- 1x tier 3 [CPU](../item/cpu3.md)
- 2x tier 3 [RAM](../item/ram5.md)
- 1x tier 2 [HDD](../item/hdd2.md)
- 1x tier 3 [HDD](../item/hdd3.md)
- 1x [floppy disk](../item/floppy.md)

The tier 4 (Creative) case can house the following components:
- 3x tier 3 Expansion cards (such as [graphics cards](../item/graphicsCard1.md), [network cards](../item/lanCard.md), etc)
- 1x tier 3 [CPU](../item/cpu3.md)
- 2x tier 3 [RAM](../item/ram5.md)
- 2x tier 3 [HDD](../item/hdd3.md)
- 1x [floppy disk](../item/floppy.md)
