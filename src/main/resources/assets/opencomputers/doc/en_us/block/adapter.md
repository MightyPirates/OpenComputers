# Adapter

![Now with 100% more everything.](oredict:oc:adapter)

The adapter allows [computers](../general/computer.md) to interact with blocks from vanilla Minecraft or other mods. Supported blocks adjacent to the adapter will show up as components in [computers](../general/computer.md) connected to the adapter.

In addition to this, the adapter provides a slot for a few select upgrades. For example, the [inventory controller upgrade](../item/inventoryControllerUpgrade.md) allows computers to query more information from an inventory adjacent to the adapter, similar to when the upgrade is installed in a device (such as a [robot](robot.md) or [drone](../item/drone.md)), and a [tank controller upgrade](../item/tankControllerUpgrade.md) provides similar functionality for fluid tanks next to the adapter.
Furthermore, you can insert a bound [MFU](../item/mfu.md) to interact with blocks a few spaces away.
