# Disk Drive

![Going round and round and...](oredict:opencomputers:diskDrive)

The disk drive can be used to read [floppy disks](../item/floppy.md) using a [computer](../general/computer.md) connected to the disk drive. This is useful to get started, since the lower tier [computer cases](case1.md) do not have a built-in floppy slot, and you'll need an operating system to boot up the [computer](../general/computer.md). An [OpenOS](../general/openOS.md) disk can be crafted using an empty [floppy disk](../item/floppy.md) and a [manual](../item/manual.md).

It can also be installed in [robots](robot.md) to allow inserting [floppy disks](../item/floppy.md) into the [robot](robot.md). This can be very useful since the only other way to transfer data to and from a robot is using networking - for example using [network cards](../item/lanCard.md).

[Disks](../item/floppy.md) can be inserted and removed without opening the disk drive's GUI by sneak-activating the disk drive (shift-right click) with the [floppy disk](../item/floppy.md) in hand.
