# Hologram Projector

![Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?](oredict:oc:hologram1)

The hologram projector is a volumetric display, i.e. it provides a three dimensional array of voxels that can be individually enabled or disabled by a connected [computer](../general/computer.md). The second tier projector, while having the same resolution as the tier 1 projector, supports displaying the individual voxels in three different user-definable colors.

Holograms can be rotated along their vertical axis by hitting them with a [wrench](../item/wrench.md) on their top or bottom. This can save some effort, so that the output doesn't have to be transformed on the software side. Holograms can also be scaled up or down as desired.
