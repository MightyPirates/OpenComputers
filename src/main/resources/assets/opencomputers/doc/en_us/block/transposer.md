# Transposer

![Such a poser.](oredict:oc:transposer)

The transposer bridges the gap between redstone controlled hoppers and [robots](robot.md), allowing [computer](../general/computer.md)-controlled transferral of items and fluids between adjacent blocks.

*Note that this block has no internal inventory.*

Besides moving things around, it can also be used to inspect the contents of the adjacent inventories, like an [adapter](adapter.md) with an [inventory controller upgrade](../item/inventoryControllerUpgrade.md) could, and the contents of adjacent tanks, like and adapter with a [tank controller upgrade](../item/tankControllerUpgrade.md) could.
