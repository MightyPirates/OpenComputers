# Geolyzer

![It rocks.](oredict:opencomputers:geolyzer)

The geolyzer can be used by [computers](../general/computer.md) to scan the terrain surrounding the geolyzer for the blocks' approximate hardness. This can be useful to generate maps of the area to display on [hologram projectors](hologram1.md) as well as to detect potentially valuable blocks (ores are usually harder than dirt and stone). Geolyzer scan results have a certain amount of noise added; in theory, multiple scans can be performed to determine a more accurate reading of a block's hardness level.

The geolyzer can also be installed in [robots](robot.md) and [tablets](../item/tablet.md) as an upgrade to allow them to scan their surroundings. Performing a scan will consume some energy, though, so using it excessively will drain the device's batteries.
