# Redstone I/O

![Hi Red.](oredict:oc:redstone)

The redstone I/O block can be used to remotely read and emit redstone signals. It behaves like a hybrid of a tier 1 and 2 [redstone card](../item/redstoneCard1.md): it can read and emit simple analog as well as bundled signals, but cannot read or emit wireless redstone signals.

When providing a side to the methods of the component exposed by this block, the directions are the global principal directions, i.e. it is recommended to use `sides.north`, `sides.east` and so on.

Like the [redstone cards](../item/redstoneCard1.md), this block injects a signal into connected [computers](../general/computer.md) when the state of a redstone signal changes - both for analog as well as for bundled signals. This block can also be configured to wake up connected [computers](../general/computer.md) when a certain input strength is exceeded, allowing automated booting of [computers](../general/computer.md).
