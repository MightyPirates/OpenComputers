# Crafting Upgrade

![Crafty.](oredict:oc:craftingUpgrade)

The crafting upgrade allows [robots](../block/robot.md) to craft shaped and shapeless recipes using items in their [inventory](../item/inventoryUpgrade.md). When crafting, the top-left 3x3 grid in the [robot](../block/robot.md)'s [inventory](../item/inventoryUpgrade.md) is used as the crafting grid. Items have to be arranged according to the recipe. Results will be placed back into the [robot](../block/robot.md)'s [inventory](../item/inventoryUpgrade.md). As with picking up items, the result will be placed into the selected slot; failing to do so will place the item in the next available empty slot. If no inventory space remains, the result will be dropped into the world.
