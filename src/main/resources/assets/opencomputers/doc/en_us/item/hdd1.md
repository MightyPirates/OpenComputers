# Hard Disk Drive

![Spaaaace.](oredict:opencomputers:hdd1)

The hard disk drives are a higher tier storage medium in OpenComputers. All storage media perform at the same speed; higher tier storage provides more space. There are also some devices that can only use disk drives (although servers could use an external [disk drive](../block/diskDrive.md), for example). Hard drives can be placed inside a [raid](../block/raid.md), allowing multiple drives to share the same file system. Note that placing a hard drive in a [raid](../block/raid.md) wipes the drive of its contents.
