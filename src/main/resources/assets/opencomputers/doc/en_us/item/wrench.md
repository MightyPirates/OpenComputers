Like pretty much any other technology-focused mod, OpenComputers has it's own version of a wrench tool. In this case, it is a hybrid of a screwdriver and a wrench, that looks like it's incredibly awkward to use. It can be used to rotate most blocks, and is also compatible with most other mods' blocks that can be interacted with by using wrench-like tools.
