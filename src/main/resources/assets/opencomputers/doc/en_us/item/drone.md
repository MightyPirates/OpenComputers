# Drone

![Big brother is trying to watch you.](item:opencomputers:drone)

Drones are built using a [drone case](droneCase1.md) in the [assembler](../block/assembler.md). They are entity-based [robots](../block/robot.md), a little cheaper with limited functionality. They are also capable of moving differently and much quicker than [robots](../block/robot.md), and are usually controlled using a client program on a [computer](../general/computer.md). The drone will need a configured [EEPROM](eeprom.md) to listen for commands to be executed or act on its own.
