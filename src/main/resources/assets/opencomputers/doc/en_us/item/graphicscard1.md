# Graphics Card

![Fancy images.](oredict:opencomputers:graphicsCard1)

The graphics card is an essential part for most [computers](../general/computer.md) and allows the [computer](../general/computer.md) to display text on a connected [screen](../block/screen1.md). Graphics cards come in several tiers, and like [screens](../block/screen1.md), support different resolutions and color depths.

Another noteworthy difference for the different graphics card tiers is the number of operations a graphics card can perform per tick. The values listed in the graphics cards' tooltips are representative for a [computer](../general/computer.md) with a tier two [CPU](cpu1.md). Tier one CPUs perform slightly slower, tier three CPUs slightly faster. The numbers listed are for the different operations provided by a GPU: `copy`, `fill`, `set`, `setBackground` and `setForeground`, respectively.
