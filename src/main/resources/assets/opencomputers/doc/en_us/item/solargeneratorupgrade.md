# Solar Generator

![Walking on the sun.](oredict:opencomputers:solarGeneratorUpgrade)

The solar generator upgrade can be installed in devices such as [robots](../block/robot.md), [drones](drone.md) and [tablets](tablet.md) to passively generate energy. It will only work while the device is exposed to direct sunlight; a device in an enclosed area or an area affected by weather will not generate energy. 

The amount of energy generated is relatively small, but it should be enough to prolong the time needed between [recharges](../block/charger.md), if not avoid them altogether.
