# Trading Upgrade

![Equivalent Exchange](oredict:opencomputers:tradingUpgrade)

The trading upgrade enables automatic trading with merchants, such as villagers. It can be used in agents such as [robots](../block/robot.md) and [drones](drone.md) and provides capabilities to identify available trades from nearby merchants, retrieve information on individual trade offers, and finally for performing trades.
