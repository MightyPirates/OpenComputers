![Serves u right.](oredict:opencomputers:server1)

Servers are a form of higher tier [computer](../general/computer.md). They can be configured by holding them in the hand and using them - like opening a backpack or Ender pouch, for example. Servers can also be configured after having been installed into a [rack](../block/rack.md) by activating them (aiming at the corresponding position on the front face on the [rack](../block/rack.md)). To operate, the server has to be placed inside a [rack](../block/rack.md). For more information see the [rack](../block/rack.md) entry.
