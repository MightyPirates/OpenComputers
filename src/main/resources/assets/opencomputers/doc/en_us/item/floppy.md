# Floppy Disk

![Many inches.](oredict:opencomputers:floppy)

The floppy disk is the cheapest and smallest type of storage medium in OpenComputers. It is a handy early-game way of storing data and transferring it between [computers](../general/computer.md) and [robots](../block/robot.md). You may also find floppy disks with useful programs on them in dungeon chests (OpenPrograms Package Manager is a good example, allowing easy install of programs from a central GitHub repository).
