# Hover Boots

![Step on it.](oredict:opencomputers:hoverBoots)

If you can't be bothered to program [drones](drone.md), here's an alternative use for them: stepping stones! Or glorified inline skates. Something like that.

Either way, these boots have a few useful properties: as long as they have power they will let you jump higher, and absorb some of the shock when landing after a particularly high jump. Specifically, they'll allow you to jump up to four blocks high and cut the impact down to one third.

Additionally, due to always being in kind of a hovering state anyway, they allow you to seamlessly walk up steps of up to one block height. This is particularly handy when sprinting up a mountain, for example, a very commonplace fitness routine amongst Minecrafters. Or so I hear.

The boots can be recharged in an OpenComputers [charger](../block/charger.md) or any other such device, like the Applied Energistics 2 charger, an IndustrialCraft 2 battery box, or the Energetic Infuser from Thermal Expansion.

You can change the boots' color by crafting them with any type of dye. Akin to leather armor, it is possible to apply multiple dyes at once or in succession to create a large variety of colors. The dye can be removed again either by crafting the boots with a bucket of water or by tossing them into a cauldron.
