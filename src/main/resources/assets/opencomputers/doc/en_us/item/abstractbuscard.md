# Abstract Bus Card

![More networking!](oredict:opencomputers:abstractBusCard)

This card allows [computers](../general/computer.md), [servers](server1.md) and [robots](../block/robot.md) to interact with StargateTech2's abstract bus. When the card is installed, these blocks will connect to the abstract bus and a component becomes available to the machine that can be used to send messages across the abstract bus. Incoming abstract bus messages are converted to signals that are injected into the machine.
