# Inventory Controller

![I'm in control.](oredict:opencomputers:inventoryControllerUpgrade)

The inventory controller upgrade provides extended inventory interaction to [robots](../block/robot.md) and [drones](drone.md). It allows the device to explicitly target slots in external inventories when dropping or sucking items. It also allows devices to read detailed information about item stacks. Lastly it provides [robots](../block/robot.md) with a means to change their equipped tool without external help.

This upgrade can also be placed in [adapters](../block/adapter.md), where it provides similar inspection methods for inventories adjacent to the [adapter](../block/adapter.md) as it does to the [robot](../block/robot.md). It does not allow the [adapter](../block/adapter.md) to move items into or out of inventories, however. This feature is only available to [robots](../block/robot.md) and [drones](drone.md).
