# Ink Cartridge

![The colors of the rainbow.](oredict:opencomputers:inkCartridge)

Ink cartridges come in handy when refilling the color buffer of [3D printers](../block/printer.md). While it is also possible to refill them using dyes directly, this is messy and very inefficient. It is strongly recommended to invest into a real OC Ink Cartridge (TM), today! (Disclaimer: they may or may cost more than the printer itself).
