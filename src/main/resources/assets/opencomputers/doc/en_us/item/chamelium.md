# Chamelium

![From Chameleon, in case you were wondering.](oredict:opencomputers:chamelium)

Chamelium is a shape-shifting material that is used when creating [3D prints](../block/print.md) in a [3D printer](../block/printer.md). On its own, it is featureless and therefore very useful for creating simple, plain and monochrome areas.

You can also combine them to create a [block of Chamelium](../block/chameliumBlock.md).

As the tooltip says, eating it can cause adverse side-effects, so consume with care. Or better yet, don't.
