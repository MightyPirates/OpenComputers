# CPU

![Braaainz.](oredict:oc:cpu1)

The central processing unit is a core part for each [computer](../general/computer.md) or [server](server1.md). It defines the architecture of the [computer](../general/computer.md), and the number of components that can be connected to the [computer](../general/computer.md) before it stops working. Higher tier CPUs also provide a higher per-tick direct call limit to the [computer](../general/computer.md) - in simpler terms: better CPUs run faster.

The number of components that the CPU allows access to is as follows:
- Tier 1: 8 components.
- Tier 2: 12 components.
- Tier 3: 16 components.

In [servers](server1.md), the number of supported components can be further increased by installing [component buses](componentBus1.md).

If more than the supported number of components are connected to a [computer](../general/computer.md), it will no longer be able to start, and if it was running, it will crash.
