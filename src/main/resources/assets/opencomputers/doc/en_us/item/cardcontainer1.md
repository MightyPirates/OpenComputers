# Card Container

![Can haz cards!](oredict:opencomputers:cardContainer1)

The card container is a container upgrade for [robots](../block/robot.md) allowing cards to be inserted/removed to/from [robots](../block/robot.md) on-the-fly. The maximum tier of card that the slot can hold is equal to the tier of the container. Unlike normal upgrades, the complexity of containers is twice their tier. See [here](../block/robot.md) for details on robot complexity.
