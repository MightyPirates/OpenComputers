# Disassembler

![Build it, tear it down.](oredict:oc:disassembler)

The disassembler can be used to deconstruct most items in OpenComputers into their original parts. This is mostly useful to reclaim materials from old parts that are no longer useful, or to deconstruct devices that are either no longer needed or were incorrectly built (e.g. [robots](robot.md) without an [operating system](../general/openOS.md)).

Disassembling items takes a long time, and some energy. There is also a slight chance of losing a component (which is applied on a component by component basis).
