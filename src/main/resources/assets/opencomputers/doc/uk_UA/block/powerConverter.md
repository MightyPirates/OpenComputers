# Power Converter

![One of us? One of us!](oredict:oc:powerConverter)

The power converter serves as the fastest way to convert energy from other mods' power systems to OpenComputers' internal energy. If you only run a simple computer, you probably won't need a converter. If you have a large capacitor bank that you only drain every now and then, you probably won't need one, either. However, if you wish to directly power an [assembler](assembler.md) or [charger](charger.md), it is usually a good idea to use a converter instead of directly connecting them to external power.
