# Keyboard

![QWERTY](oredict:oc:keyboard)

A Keyboard is needed to type text on [Screens](screen1.md), be they in the world or built into devices such as [Robots](robot.md) or [Tablets](tablet.md).

For a keyboard to work with a screen in the world, it has to be placed next to the screen, facing that screen, or placed directly on the screen (on top or on one of its sides). You can tell that a keyboard is "connected" to a screen if by right-clicking the keyboard the screen's GUI opens up.
