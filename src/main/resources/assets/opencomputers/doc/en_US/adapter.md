# Adapter

![Now with 100% more everything.](oredict:oc:adapter)

The Adapter allows computers to interact with a number of blocks that are not part of OpenComputers, such as blocks from Minecraft itself (like the Furnace) and from a number of other mods. Supported blocks adjacent to the adapter will show up as components in [computers](case1.md) connected to the adapter.

In addition to this, the adapter provides a slot for a few select upgrades. For example, the [Inventory Controller Upgrade](inventoryControllerUpgrade.md) allows computers to query more information from an inventory adjacent to the adapter, similar to when the upgrade is installed in a device, and a [Tank Controller Upgrade](tankControllerUpgrade.md) provides similar functionality for fluid tanks next to the adapter.
