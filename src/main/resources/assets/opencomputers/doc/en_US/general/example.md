![This is a tooltip...](/textures/gui/printer_material.png)
*This* is *italic* text, ~~strikethrough~~ maybe abc-ter **some** text **in bold**. Is _this underlined_? Oh, no, _it's also italic!_ Well, this [a link](blah).

## Smaller headline [also with *link* but this __one__ longer](../block/adapter.md)

![This is another tooltip.](item:OpenComputers:item@23)

![All the colors.](oredict:craftingPiston)

This is *italic
over two* lines. But *this ... no *this is* **_bold italic_** *text*.

### even smaller

*not italic *because ** why would it be*eh
