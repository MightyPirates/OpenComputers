# Chunk Loader Upgrade

![Not going anywhere.](oredict:oc:chunkLoaderUpgrade)

The Chunkloader Upgrade can be installed in devices to allow them too keep the chunk they are in - as well as the surrounding chunks - loaded. This consumes quite a bit of energy, however. The chunkloader can be turned on and off using the component the upgrade exposes to the device.

The upgrade is automatically enabled when the device powers up, and automatically disabled when the device powers down.
