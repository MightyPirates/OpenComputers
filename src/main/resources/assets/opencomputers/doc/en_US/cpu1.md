# CPU

![Braaainz.](oredict:oc:cpu1)

The Central Processing Unit is a core part for each computer. It defines the architecture of the computer, and the number of components that can be connected to the computer before it stops working. Higher tier CPUs also provide a higher per-tick direct call limit to the computer - in simpler terms: better CPUs run faster.
