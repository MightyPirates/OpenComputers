- 2x Tier 1 [RAM](ram1.md)
- 1x Tier 1 [HDD](hdd1.md)

The Tier 2 Case can house up to and including the following components:
- 1x Tier 1 Expansion Card (such as [graphics cards](gpu1.md), [network cards](lanCard.md), etc)
- 1x Tier 2 Expansion Card
- 1x Tier 2 [CPU](cpu1.md)
- 2x Tier 2 [RAM](ram1.md)
- 1x Tier 1 [HDD](hdd1.md)
- 1x Tier 2 [HDD](hdd1.md)

The Tier 3 Case can house up to and including the following components:
- 1x Tier 3 Expansion Card (such as [graphics cards](gpu1.md), [network cards](lanCard.md), etc)
- 2x Tier 2 Expansion Card
- 1x Tier 3 [CPU](cpu1.md)

- 1x Tier 2 [HDD](hdd1.md)
- 1x Tier 3 [HDD](hdd1.md)
- 1x [floppy disk](floppy.md)

The Tier 4 (Creative) Case can house the following components:
- 3x Tier 3 Expansion Cards (such as [graphics cards](gpu1.md), [network cards](lanCard.md), etc)
- 1x Tier 3 [CPU](cpu1.md)
