![Can haz upgrade.](oredict:oc:upgradeContainer)

The Upgrade Container is a container type upgrade for [robots](robot.md), that provides a slot in the finished robots into which normal upgrades can be placed. The tier of upgrade that slot can hold is equal to the tier of the container. Unlike normal upgrades, the complexity of containers is twice their tier.
