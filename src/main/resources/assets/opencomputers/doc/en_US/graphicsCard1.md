The Graphics Card is an essential part for most computers and allows the computer to display text on a connected [Screen](screen1.md). Graphics cards come in several tiers, and like screens, support different resolutions and color depths.

Another noteworthy difference for the different graphics card tiers is the number of operations a graphics card can perform per tick. The values listed in the graphics cards' tooltip is representative for a computer with a tier two [CPU](cpu1.md). Tier one CPUs perform slightly slower, tier three CPUs slightly faster. The numbers listed are for the different operations provided by a GPU: copy, fill, set, setBackground and setForeground, respectively.
