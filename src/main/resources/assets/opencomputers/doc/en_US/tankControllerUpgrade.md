# Tank Controller

![Fluid routing.](oredict:oc:tankControllerUpgrade)

The Tank Controller Upgrade is to fluid tanks what the [Inventory Controller Upgrade](inventoryControllerUpgrade.md) is to normal inventories. It allows devices to query more detailed information about tanks in and next to them.

This upgrade can also be installed in [Adapters](adapter.md), allowing computers connected to the adapter to query information about the tanks adjacent to the adapter.
