# Crafting Upgrade

![Crafty.](oredict:oc:craftingUpgrade)

The Crafting Upgrade allows [robots](robot.md) to craft shaped and shapeless recipes using items in their inventory. When crafting, the top-left three by three grid in the robot's inventory is used as the crafting grid. Items have to be located as they would be in a normal crafting table. Results will be placed back into the robot's inventory. As when picking up items, the result will preferrably placed into the selected slot, and failing so continue to search forwards until an empty slot is found. If no inventory space remains, the result will be dropped into the world.
