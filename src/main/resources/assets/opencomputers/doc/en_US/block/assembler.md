# Assembler

![Harder, better, faster, stronger.](oredict:oc:assembler)

The Assembler is an advanced workstation that can be used to build more complex electronic devices, such as [robots](robot.md), [drones](../item/drone.md) and [tablets](../item/tablet.md). They usually require a relatively large amount of energy to assemble these devices, to it is recommended to power them sufficiently.

To build a device using an assembler, first insert the base part for that device. For robots that is a computer case of any tier, for tablets that is a tablet case, for example. Continue to insert any parts you would like the device to contain. Take particular care to provide an operating system, or a possibility to install one later on (for robots you can install a [disk drive](diskDrive.md) to insert and remove [floppies](../item/floppy.md) later on, for example).

Also note that for robots to have a [screen](screen1.md) you need to install a tier one screen in them, and to allow typing on the screen you also need to install a [keyboard](keyboard.md). For tablets the screen is pre-installed in the tablet case, but you still need to install a keyboard if you wish to type on your tablet.

Once everything is in place, press the start button and wait for the device to be assembled and charged. It is important to remember that you §lcannot§r change the device after it has been assembled. If you forgot something or made a mistake, you will have to disassemble the device completely using the [disassembler](disassembler.md), which has a slight chance of breaking parts in the process.
