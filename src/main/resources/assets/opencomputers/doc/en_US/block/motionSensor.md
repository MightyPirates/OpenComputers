# Motion Sensor

![Don't. Blink.](oredict:oc:motionSensor)

The Motion Sensor allows computers to detect movement of living entities. If an entity moves faster than a set threshold, a signal will be injected into computers connected to the motion sensor. The threshold can be configured via the component the motion sensor exposes to connected computers.

Movement is only detected if it happens within a radius of eight blocks around the motion sensor, and if there is a direct line of sight from the block to the entity that moved.
