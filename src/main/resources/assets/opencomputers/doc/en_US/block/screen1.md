# Screens

![See this?](oredict:oc:screen1)

A Screen is used in combination with a [graphics card](../item/graphicsCard1.md), to allow computers to display text. Different screen tiers have different capabilties, such as supporting different resolutions and color depths. Screens range from low-resolution, monochrome displays to high-resolution displays with up to 256 colors. 

The available resolution and color depth depends on the lowest tier component. When using a [graphics card (tier 1)](../item/graphicsCard1.md) with a [screen (tier 3)](screen3.md), only the tier 1 resolution and color depth is usable.

Screens can be placed next to each other to form multi-block screens. This has no impact on the available resolution. To control how adjacent screens connect, screens can also be dyed using any dye. Screens with different colors will not connect. Screens with different tiers will never connect, even if they have the same color.

Tier 2 and tier 3 screens also support mouse input. Clicks can either be performed in a screen's GUI (which can only be opened if a keyboard is connected to the screen), or by sneak-activating a screen empty-handed. Note that whether the GUI opens when sneak- or normally activating a screen can be controlled via the component it exposes to connected computers.

The resolutions and color depths for the screens are as follows:
- Tier 1: 50x16, 1-bit color.
- Tier 2: 80x25, 4-bit color.
- Tier 3: 160x50, 8-bit color.
