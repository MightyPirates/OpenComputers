# Disassembler

![Build it, tear it down.](oredict:oc:disassembler)

The Disassembler can be used to deconstruct most items in OpenComputers into their original parts. This is mostly useful to reclaim materials from old parts that are no longer useful, or to decompose devices that are either no longer needed or built broken (e.g. [robots](robot.md) without an operating system).

Disassembling items takes a relatively long time, and quite some energy. It also has a certain risk to destroy the reclaimed items - this chance is applied to each extracted item - so be sure to not carelessly throw things into the disassembler.
