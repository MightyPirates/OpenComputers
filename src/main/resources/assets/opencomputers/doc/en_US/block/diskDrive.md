# Disk Drive

![Going round and round and...](oredict:oc:diskDrive)

The Disk Drive can be used to read [floppies](../item/floppy.md) using a computer connected to the disk drive. This is useful to get started, since the lower tier computer cases do not have a built-in floppy slot, and you'll need an operating system to get started - which usually only come on floppy disks (such the craftable OpenOS one).

It can also be installed in [robots](robot.md) to allow inserting an removing floppy disks into and from the robot at any time, which can be very useful, since the only other way to transfer data from a robot is using networking - for example using [network cards](../item/lanCard.md).
