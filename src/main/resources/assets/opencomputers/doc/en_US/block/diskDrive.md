# Disk Drive

![Going round and round and...](oredict:oc:diskDrive)

The Disk Drive can be used to read [floppy disks](../item/floppy.md) using a computer connected to the disk drive. This is useful to get started, since the lower tier [computer cases](../case1.md) do not have a built-in floppy slot, and you'll need an operating system to get started. An OpenOS disk can be crafted using an empty [floppy disk](../item/floppy.md) and a Book. 

It can also be installed in [robots](robot.md) to allow inserting an removing [floppy disks](../item/floppy.md) into and from the robot at any time. This can be very useful since the only other way to transfer data to and from a robot is using networking - for example using [network cards](../item/lanCard.md).
