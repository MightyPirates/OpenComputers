# Geolyzer

![It rocks.](oredict:oc:geolyzer)

The Geolyzer can be used by computers to scan the terrain surrounding the geolyzer for the blocks' approximate hardness. This can be useful to generate maps of the area to display on [Hologram Projectors](hologram1.md) as well as to detect potentially valuable blocks (ores are usually harder than dirt and stone).

The geolyzer can also be installed in [robots](robot.md) as an upgrade to allow them to scan their surroundings. Performing a scan will consume some energy, though, so using it excessivly may quickly drain a robot's batteries.
