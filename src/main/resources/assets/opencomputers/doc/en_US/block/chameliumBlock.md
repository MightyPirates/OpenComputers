# Chaemlium Block

![So... blank.](oredict:oc:chameliumBlock)

A bunch of [Chaemlium](../item/chamelium.md) slapped together, this can be nice to decorate parts of your base, if you want a clean, monochrome block. Can be dyed to take any one of the 16 common Minecraft colors.

Another use is to pick its texture and use that in your [3D prints](print.m3d), if you want something clean white to apply a tint to.
