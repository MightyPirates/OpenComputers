# Robot

![His name was Tobor.](block:OpenComputers:robot)

Unlike computers, robots can move around and interact with the world much like a player can. They can *not* interact with external components, however! If you need to communicate with a computer or other robots, use a [wireless network card](../item/wlanCard.md), or create some low-level protocol using redstone signals via a [redstone card](../item/redstoneCard1.md), for example.

Robots are built by placing a [computer case](case1.md) in an [assembler](assembler.md).
