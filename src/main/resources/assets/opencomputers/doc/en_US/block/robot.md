Unlike computers, robots can move around and interact with the world much like a player can. They can *not* interact with external components, however! If you need to communicate with a computer or other robots, use a [wireless network card](../item/wlanCard.md), or create some low-level protocol using redstone signals via a [redstone card](../item/redstoneCard1.md), for example.

Robots are built by placing a [computer case](case1.md) of any tier in an [assembler](assembler.md). Higher tier computer cases can build more complex robots, due to being able to hold a higher tier [CPU](../item/cpu1.md). Complexity of the robot (as shown in the [assembler](assembler.md)) is determined by the tier of the components and upgrades placed in the robot slots; higher tier components will increase the complexity more than a lower tier component. If the complexity of the robot is too high, the [assembler](assembler.md) will not build the robot. 

Various upgrades can be placed into robots to increase the functionality. These include [inventory](../item/inventoryUpgrade.md) and [inventory controller](../item/inventoryControllerUpgrade.md) upgrades, [tank upgrades](../tankUpgrade.md), [navigation upgrade](../item/navigationUpgrade.md), among others. [Upgrade](../item/upgradeContainer1.md) and [card](../item/cardContainer1.md) containers can be placed in the robot for on-the-fly insertion and removal of upgrades and components. A [disk drive](diskDrive.md) can also be placed inside a robot to allow [floppy disks](../item/floppy.md) to be inserted, which will let you install openOS to the robot (an alternative is to install openOS to a blank [hard drive](../item/hdd1.md) using a computer, and using the pre-installed [hard drive](../item/hdd1.md) as a component in the robot assembly).
