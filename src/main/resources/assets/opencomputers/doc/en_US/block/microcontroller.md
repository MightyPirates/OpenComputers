Microcontrollers are built using a [microcontroller case](microcontrollerCase1.md) in the [assembler](../block/assembler.md). They have less functionality compared to computers. 

Microcontrollers can take various components, such as [CPUs](../item/cpu1.md), [memory (RAM)](../item/ram1.md), and Expansion cards. Microcontrollers are unable to contain a [hard disk drive](../item/hdd1.md), but do contain a slot for an [EEPROM](../item/eeprom.md), which can be programmed for very specific tasks.
