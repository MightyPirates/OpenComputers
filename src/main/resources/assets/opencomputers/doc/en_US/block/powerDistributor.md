# Power Distributor

![Power to the masses.](oredict:oc:powerDistributor)

The Power Distributor distributes a shared power storage (such as a [capacitor](capacitor.md)), allowing several subnetworks to share their energy, without components being exposed to computers in other networks. It operates by regularly "balancing" the energy in all subnetworks it is connected to, so that the *relative* amount of energy is the same in them.
