# Charger

![Allright, let's do this.](oredict:oc:charger)

The Charger is used to charge devices such as [robots](robot.md), [drones](../item/drone.md) and [tablets](../item/tablet.md). A charger has to be activated by applying a redstone signal to it. The relative charge speed is based on the applied redstone signal's strength, with a strength of 15 meaning a charge speed of 100%.

Note that this logic can be inversed by hitting the charger with a BuildCraft compatible wrench. In inversed mode the charger defaults to 100% charge speed, and a higher redstone signal will result in a slower charge speed.

When a [tablet](../item/tablet.md) is placed in the charger, its first [hard drive](../item/hdd1.md) is also exposed to [computers](../general/computer.md) connected to the charger, similar to how [floppies](../item/floppy.md) in [disk drives](diskDrive.md) are. This allows transferring of data between the [computer](../general/computer.md) and [tablet](../item/tablet.md).
