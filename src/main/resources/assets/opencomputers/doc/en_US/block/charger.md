# Charger

![Allright, let's do this.](oredict:oc:charger)

The Charger is used to charge devices such as [Robots](robot.md), [Drones](drone.md) and [Tablets](tablet.md). A charger has to be activated by applying a redstone signal to it. The relative charge speed is based on the applied redstone signal's strength, with a strength of 15 meaning a charge speed of 100%.

Note that this logic can be inversed by hitting the charger with a BuildCraft compatible wrench. In inversed mode the charger defaults to 100% charge speed, and a higher redstone signal will result in a slower charge speed.

When a tablet is placed in the charger, its first [hard drive](hdd1.md) is also exposed to [computers](case1.md) connected to the charger, similar to how [Floppies](floppy.md) in [Disk Drives](diskDrive.md) are. This allows copying data onto or from a tablet, if desired.
