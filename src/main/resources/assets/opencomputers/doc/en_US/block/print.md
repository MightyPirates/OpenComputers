# 3D Print

![Any way you want me.](block:OpenComputers:print)

3D prints are created using a [3D printer](printer.md). They are primarily intended for decorative purposes, but can also be created in such a way that they react to or emit redstone signals, allowing for a little bit of functional behavior on the side.

3D prints can be recycled by putting them as input into a 3D printer. This will re-use some of the [chamelium](../item/chamelium.md) that was used to print them. Color that was used to print the model will not be recylced.
