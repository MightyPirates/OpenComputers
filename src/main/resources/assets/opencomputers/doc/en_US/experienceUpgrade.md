# Experience Upgrade

![This makes no sense, but it's cool.](oredict:oc:experienceUpgrade)

The Experience Upgrade is a very special upgrade, as it allows [robots](robot.md) and [drones](drone.md) to collect experience by performing various actions, such as digging up ores and killing entities. A single upgrade can store up to 30 levels, providing passive bonuses with each level, including faster harvest speeds and increased energy buffer capacity.

Robots at level ten and above will get a golden tint, robots at level twenty and above will get a diamond tint.

The actual experience is stored inside the upgrade, meaning if the upgrade is transferred to another device, so is the experience.
