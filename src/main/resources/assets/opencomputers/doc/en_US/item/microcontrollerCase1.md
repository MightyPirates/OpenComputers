# Microcontroller Case

![It's so cute.](oredict:oc:microcontrollerCase1)

The Microcontroller Case is the base part when building [microcontrollers](microcontroller.md) in the [Assembler](assembler.md). Microcontrollers are very primitive computers. They may only contain a very limited number of components, and are intended to be used in very specific use-cases, such as transforming or reacting to redstone signals, or processing network messages.

They do not have an actual file system. All programming must be done using the [EEPROM](eeprom.md) chip built into them. This chip can be swapped for another one by crafting a microcontroller with the chip to insert. The old EEPROM will be returned to your inventory.

While they also require power to run, they consume very little energy.
