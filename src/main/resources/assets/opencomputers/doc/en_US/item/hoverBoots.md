# Hover Boots

![Step on it.](oredict:oc:hoverBoots)

If you can't be bothered to program [drones](drone.md), here's an alternative use for them: stepping stones! Or glorified inline skates. Something like that.

Either way, these boots have a few useful properties: as long as they have power they will let you jump higher, and absorb some of the shock when landing after a particularly high jump. Specifically, they'll allow you to jump up to four blocks high and cut the impact down to one third.

Additionally, due to always being in kind of a hovering state anyway, they allow you to seamlessly walk up steps of up to one block height. This is particularly handy when sprinting up a mountain, for example, a very commonplace fitness routine amongst Minecrafters. Or so I hear.

The boots can be recharged in an OpenComputers [charger](../block/charger.md) or any other such device, like the Applied Energistics 2 charger, an IndustrialCraft 2 battery box, or the Energetic Infuser from Thermal Expansion.
