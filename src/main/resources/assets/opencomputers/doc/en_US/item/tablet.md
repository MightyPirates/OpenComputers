# Tablet

![Touch me if you can.](item:OpenComputers:item@68)

Tablets are built by placing a [tablet case](tabletCase1.md) into an [assembler](../block/assembler.md), configuring as desired and assembling it. Tablets act as portable computers that cannot directly interact with the world - for example, basic [redstone cards](redstoneCard1.md) do not work in them. A number of upgrades do, such as the [sign i/o](signUpgrade.md) upgrade or the [piston](pistonUpgrade.md) upgrade.

To force rebooting a tablet, shift-rightclick it while holding it in your hand. Unlike computers, tablets do not persist across the player holding it leaving and re-entering the game. They also do not persist across the player holding the tablet changing dimensions (e.g. going to the Nether or back).

Tablets can be put into a [charger](../block/charger.md) to refill their energy, and to access the first [hard drive](hdd1.md) built into the tablet from a [computer](../general/computer.md) connected to the charger - in this setup, the charger will act similar to a [disk drive](../block/diskDrive.md), with the tablet being the [floppy disk](floppy.md). This can be very useful in case you forgot to install an OS on the hard drive built into the tablet, or after bricking a tablet's OS.
