# Piston Upgrade

![Push it.](oredict:oc:pistonUpgrade)

The piston upgrade allows some devices to act very much like a vanilla piston. When installed, a component with a single method, *push()*, becomes available. When called the device will then try to push the block in its forward facing direction. For example, for [robots](../block/robot.md) this is their facing, for [tablets](tablet.md) it's the player's facing, for [microcontrollers](../block/microcontroller.md) it is their facing.

The logic for pushing follows the same rules as vanilla pistons.
