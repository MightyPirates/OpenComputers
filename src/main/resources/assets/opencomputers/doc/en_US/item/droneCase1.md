# Drone Case

![Droning on.](oredict:oc:droneCase1)

The Drone Case is used to build [drones](drone.md) in the [assembler](../block/assembler.md). Drones are light-weight, fast and very mobile machines with limited functionality. Unlike [robots](../block/robot.md) they cannot use tools, and can interact with the world only in a relatively limited manner.

They make up for their limitations with speed and lower running energy costs. They are well suited for transport of small amounts of items, and ideal for reconnaissance. Pairing a Drone with a Robot can be quite powerful, with the Robot doing the "hard work", and the Drone providing information about the environment and transporting items to and from a central hub, for example.

Like [microcontrollers](../block/microcontroller.md), Drones can only be programmed using their [EEPROM](eeprom.md). Accordingly, the EEPROM can be changed by recrafting the Drone with another EEPROM.
