# Inventory Controller

![I'm in control.](oredict:oc:inventoryControllerUpgrade)

The Inventory Controller Upgrade provides extended inventory interaction to [robots](../block/robot.md) and [drones](drone.md). It allows the device to excplicitly target slots in external inventories when dropping or sucking items. It also allows devices to read detailed information about item stacks. Lastly it provides robots with a means to change their equipped tool without external help.

This upgrade can also be placed in [adapters](../block/adapter.md), where it provides similar inspection methods for inventories adjacent to the adapter as it does to the robot. It does not allow the adapter to move items into or out of inventories, however. This feature is only available in robots and drones.
