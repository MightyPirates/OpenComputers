# Hard Disk Drive

![Spaaaace.](oredict:oc:hdd1)

The Hard Disk Drives are the higher tier storage medium in OpenComputers. There are no speed differences in the storage media provided by OpenComputers, they only differ in the amount of disk space they provide. There are also some devices that can only use disk drives, no [floppies](floppy.md) (although servers could use an external [disk drive](diskDrive.md), for example).
