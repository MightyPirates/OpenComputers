# Tank Controller

![Fluid routing.](oredict:oc:tankControllerUpgrade)

The tank controller upgrade is to fluid tanks what the [inventory controller upgrade](inventoryControllerUpgrade.md) is to normal inventories. It allows devices to query more detailed information about tanks inside and next to them.

This upgrade can also be installed in [adapters](../block/adapter.md), allowing [computers](../general/computer.md) connected to the [adapter](../block/adapter.md) to query information about the tanks adjacent to the [adapter](../block/adapter.md).
