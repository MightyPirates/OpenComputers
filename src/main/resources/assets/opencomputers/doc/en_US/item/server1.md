# Server

![Serves u right.](oredict:oc:server1)

Servers are a form of higher tier [computer](../general/computer.md). They can be configured by holding them in the hand and using them - like opening a backpack or Ender pouch, for example. After inserting a [CPU](cpu1.md), [memory](ram1.md) and Expansion cards, the server has to be placed inside a [server rack](../block/serverRack.md). For more information see the [server rack](../block/serverRack.md) entry.

The tier 1 server is capable of taking the following components: 
- 1x tier 2 [CPU](cpu2.md)
- 2x tier 2 [RAM](ram3.md)
- 2x tier 2 [HDD](hdd2.md)
- 1x tier 2 [component bus](componentBus2.md)
- 2x Expansion cards (tier 2)
- 1x [EEPROM](eeprom.md)

The tier 2 server is capable of taking the following components: 
- 1x tier 3 [CPU](cpu3.md)
- 3x tier 3 [RAM](ram5.md)
- 3x tier 3 [HDD](hdd3.md)
- 2x tier 3 [component bus](componentBus3.md)
- 2x Expansion cards (tier 2)
- 1x Expansion card (tier 3)
- 1x [EEPROM](eeprom.md)

The tier 3 server is capable of taking the following components: 
- 1x tier 3 [CPU](cpu3.md)
- 4x tier 3 [RAM](ram5.md)
- 4x tier 3 [HDD](hdd3.md)
- 3x tier 3 [component bus](componentBus3.md)
- 2x Expansion cards (tier 2)
- 2x Expansion cards (tier 3)
- 1x [EEPROM](eeprom.md)

The tier 4 (Creative) server is capable of taking the following components: 
- 1x tier 3 [CPU](cpu3.md)
- 4x tier 3 [RAM](ram5.md)
- 4x tier 3 [HDD](hdd3.md)
- 3x tier 3 [component bus](componentBus3.md)
- 4x Expansion cards (tier 3)
- 1x [EEPROM](eeprom.md)
