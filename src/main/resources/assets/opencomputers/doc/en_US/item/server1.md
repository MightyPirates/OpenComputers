# Server

![Serves u right.](oredict:oc:server1)

Servers are a form of higher tier computer. They can be configured by holding them in the hand and rightclicking - like opening a backpack or ender pouch, for example. After inserting [CPU](cpu1.md), [memory](ram1.md) and cards, the server has to be placed inside a [Server Rack](serverRack.md). For more information see the server rack entry.
