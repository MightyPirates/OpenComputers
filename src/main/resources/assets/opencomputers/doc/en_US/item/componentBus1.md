# Component Bus

![I need mooooore.](oredict:oc:componentBus1)

A Component Bus is a [server](server1.md)-specific upgrade that allows the server to communicate with more components at the same time, without shutting down. Like with [CPUs](cpu1.md), higher tier buses provide higher component limits. Higher tier [servers](server1.md) are also capable of taking more component buses, allowing for communication with many more components. 

The number of components each component bus allows access to is as follows:
- Tier 1: 8 components.
- Tier 2: 12 components.
- Tier 3: 16 components.
