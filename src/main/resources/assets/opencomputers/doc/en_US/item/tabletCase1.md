# Tablet Case

![Doesn't bend.](oredict:oc:tabletCase1)

The Tablet Case is the base part when building [tablets](tablet.md) in the [assembler](../block/assembler.md). Tablets are very compact and portable computers. They can host a small number of select upgrades, but obviously cannot interact with the world like [computer cases](../block/case1.md) can (using simple [network cards](lanCard.md) or [redstone cards](redstoneCard1.md) for example).

Upgrades and cards that cannot be used in tablets can generally not be placed into the assembler, so if you can install an upgrade, you can usually assume that you will also be able to use it.

They must also remain in a player's inventory to continue running. When dropped or placed into some other inventory, they will turn off after a short amount of time.
