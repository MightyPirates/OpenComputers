# Manual

![A good read.](oredict:oc:manual)

The thing you're reading right now! The manual contains a wealth of information about OpenComputers (and possibly more). If you need information on an item or block in the mod, look no further! Then realize your question isn't answered and alt-tab to the wiki. Or IRC. Or the forums. Anyway! Most basic questions (and some advanced ones) should be covered by the manual.

## Usage

There are two main ways you can look things up in the manual: manual navigation (pun maybe intended) by following the links, or by sneak-activating a supported block while holding the manual in your hand; the latter will open the page for that block in the manual.

To navigate left-click on links (green text [like this one](../index.md)) to follow them, right-click anywhere or press space to go back to the previous page. Press escape to close the manual immediately. If you're lost, use the tabs to the left to return to and index page.
