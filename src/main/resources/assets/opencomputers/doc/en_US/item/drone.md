# Drone

![Big brother is trying to watch you.](item:OpenComputers:item@84)

Drones are built using a [drone case](droneCase1.md) in the [assembler](../block/assembler.md). They are entity-based [robots](../block/robot.md), a little cheaper with limited functionality. They are also capable of moving differently than robots, and are controlled using client program on a computer. The drone will need a configured [EEPROM](eeprom.md) to listen for commands to be executed.
