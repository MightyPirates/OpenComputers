# Card Container

![Can haz cards!](oredict:oc:cardContainer)

The Card Container is a container type upgrade for [robots](../block/robot.md) that provides a slot in the finished robots into which cards can be placed. The tier of card that the slot can hold is equal to the tier of the container. Unlike normal upgrades, the complexity of containers is twice their tier. See [here](../block/robot.md) for details on robot complexity.
