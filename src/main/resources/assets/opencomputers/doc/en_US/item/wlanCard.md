# WLAN Card

![May cause cancer. May not.](oredict:oc:wlanCard)

The Wireless Network Card is an upgraded [Network Card](lanCard.md) that, in addition to wired network messages, can also send and receive wireless network messages. The signal strength directly controls the distance up to which a sent message can be received, where the strength is equal to that distance in blocks.

The higher the signal strength, the more energy it will take to send a single message. The terrain between the sender and receiver also determines whether a message will be successfully transmitted or not. To penetrate a block, the blocks hardness is subtracted from the signal strength - with the minimum being one for air blocks. If no strength remains to reach the receiver, the message will not be received. This is not an exact science however - sometimes messages may still reach the target. In general you'll want to make sure the line of sight between sender and receiver are clear, however.
