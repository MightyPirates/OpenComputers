# Redstone Card

![Seeing red.](oredict:oc:redstoneCard1)

The Redstone Card allows computers to read and emit analog redstone signal in adjacent blocks. When an incoming signal strength changes, a signal is injected into the computer.

If there are any supported mods present that provide bundled redstone facilities, such as RedLogic, Project Red or MineFactory Reloaded, or mods that provide wireless redstone facilities such as WR-CBE and Slimevoid's Wireless mod, a second tier card is available that allows interacting with these systems.

The side provided to the several methods are relative to the orientation of the [computer case](../block/case1.md) / [robot](..block/robot.md) / [server rack](../block/serverRack.md). That means when looking at the front of the computer, **sides.right** is at your left and vice versa.
