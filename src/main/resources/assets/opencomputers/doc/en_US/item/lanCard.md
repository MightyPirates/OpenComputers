# Network Card

![Enter the network.](oredict:oc:lanCard)

The Network Card allows computers to send and receive network messages. Such messages (or packets) can be either sent as a broadcast, in which case they will be sent to all nodes in the same subnetwork, or sent to specific target, in which case they will only be received by the node with the specified target address. [Switches](switch.md) and [Access Points](accessPoint.md) can be used to bridge multiple subnetworks by relaying messages between the subnetworks they are connected to. It is also possible to send a targeted message if the receiver is in another subnetwork, if the networks are connected via one or more switches.
