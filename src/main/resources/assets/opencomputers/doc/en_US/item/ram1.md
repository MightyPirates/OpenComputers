# Memory

![Do you remember, dancing in September~](oredict:oc:ram1)

Memory is, like a [CPU](cpu1.md), an essential part in all computers. Depending on the CPU's architecture, the memory has a very essential effect on what a computer can and cannot do. For the standard Lua architecture, for example, it controls the actual amount of memory Lua scripts can use. This means that to run larger and more memory-intensive programs, you'll need more RAM.
