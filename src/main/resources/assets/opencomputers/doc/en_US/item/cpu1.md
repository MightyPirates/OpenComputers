# CPU

![Braaainz.](oredict:oc:cpu1)

The Central Processing Unit is a core part for each [computer](../general/computer.md) or [server](server1.md). It defines the architecture of the computer, and the number of components that can be connected to the computer before it stops working. Higher tier CPUs also provide a higher per-tick direct call limit to the computer - in simpler terms: better CPUs run faster.

The number of components that the CPU allows access to is as follows:
- Tier 1: 8 components.
- Tier 2: 12 components.
- Tier 3: 16 components.
