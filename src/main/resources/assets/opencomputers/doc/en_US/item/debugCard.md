# Debug Card

![Wait, if I- oooooh.](oredict:oc:debugCard)

The Debug Card is a non-craftable item that was originally only intended to make debugging things easier, by automating some processes. It has since gotten a bunch more functionality, making it quite useful for custom map-making.

Note that you can use shift-rightclick while holding the card to bind it to you / unbind it, meaning *runCommand* will be performed using your permission levels instead of the default OpenComputers ones.
