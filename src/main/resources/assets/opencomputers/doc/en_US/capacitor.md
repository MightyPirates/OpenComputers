# Capacitor

![It's over 9000.](oredict:oc:assembler)

The Capacitor has one job, storing a bunch of energy, either as a failsafe or for quick use. Unlike when converting energy from other mods' power systems to the internal energy format, transfer inside a single OC subnetwork is pretty much instantaneous, so it can be of advantage to store some energy internally, for tasks that consume a lot of energy, such as assembling devices in the [Assembler](assembler.md) or charging [Robots](robot.md).

The storage efficiency of capacitors increases the more capacitors are in their direct and indirect vicinity. For example, two capacitors directly next to each other will have a higher storage capacity than the sum of two separated capacitors. This adjacency bonus applies for capacitors up to two blocks away, with slightly less of a bonus for capacitors two blocks away than for capacitors one block away.
