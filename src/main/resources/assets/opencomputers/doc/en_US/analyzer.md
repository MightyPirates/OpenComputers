# Analyzer

![Must. Resist. Bad. Joke.](oredict:oc:analyzer)

The Analyzer is a handy tool for getting some information about OpenComputers-related blocks in the world. Simply (sneak-)activate a block to get some information printed to the chat. This ranges from basic things like the address of components, to power levels in the subnetwork the block is in, and information on the error lead to a computer to crash, for example.

Another useful functionality is that when using the using the analyzer on a block while holding down [Ctrl] the address of the block component will be copied to the clipboard.
