# Tablet

![Touch me if you can.](item:OpenComputers:item@68)

Tablets are built by placing a [tablet case](tabletCase1.md) into an [assembler](../block/assembler.md), configuring as desired and assembling it. Tablets act as portable computers that cannot directly interact with the world - for example, basic [redstone cards](redstoneCard1.md) do not work in them. A number of upgrades do, such as the [sign i/o](signUpgrade.md) upgrade or the [piston](pistonUpgrade.md) upgrade.

The tier 2 tablet also allows installing a single container upgrade. The slot provided by the container can be accessed by opening the tablet's alternative GUI, by shift-right clicking with the tablet in hand. This will also forcibly shut down the tablet.

Unlike computers, tablets do not persist across the player holding it leaving and re-entering the game. They also do not persist across dimensions (such as a player going to the Nether and back). 

Tablets can be put into a [charger](../block/charger.md) to refill their energy, and to access the first [hard drive](hdd1.md) in the tablet from a [computer](../general/computer.md) connected to the charger - in this setup, the charger will behave similar to a [disk drive](../block/diskDrive.md), with the tablet being the [floppy disk](floppy.md). This can be very useful in case you forgot to install an OS on the hard drive built into the tablet, or after bricking a tablet's OS.

Another advanced feature of the tablet is its ability to generate signals with information about certain blocks in the world, by using it on a block in the world for about one second (e.g. keep the right mouse button pressed). A short beep tone will notify you that the signal was generated. This only works if upgrades are installed in the tablet that populate the signal with information. For example, the [geolyzer](../block/geolyzer.md) will add information about the block itself, such as its hardness, the [navigation upgrade](navigationUpgrade.md) will add the coordinates of the block relative to the player holding the tablet. The block to be analyzed will be highlighted with a green overlay while holding the tablet.
