# Chunk Loader Upgrade

![Not going anywhere.](oredict:oc:chunkloaderUpgrade)

The chunk loader upgrade can be installed in devices (such as [robots](../block/robot.md) and [microcontrollers](../block/microcontroller.md)) to allow them to keep the chunk they are in - as well as the surrounding chunks - loaded. This consumes energy, however. The chunk loader can be turned on and off using the component API exposed to the device.

The upgrade is automatically enabled when the device powers up, and automatically disabled when the device powers down.
