# 染色方块

![So... blank.](oredict:oc:chameliumBlock)

几篇[印刷电路板](../item/chamelium.md) 可以被变成特殊装饰用途的有色方块. 

可以被原版任意染色

A few pieces of [chamelium](../item/chamelium.md) can be combined to provide a monochrome block for decorative purposes. Chamelium blocks can also be dyed with any of the 16 Minecraft colors. 

Using the Chamelium block as a texture for [3D prints](print.md) provides a clean white surface for applying tints.
