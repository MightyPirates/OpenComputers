# 3D Print

![Any way you want me.](block:OpenComputers:print)

3D prints are created using a [3D printer](printer.md). They are primarily intended for decorative purposes, but can also be created in such a way that they react to or emit redstone signals, allowing for a little bit extra functionality.

3D prints can be recycled by putting them as input into a [3D printer](printer.md). This will re-use some of the [chamelium](../item/chamelium.md) that was used to print them. Color that was used to print the model will not be recycled.

Holding the key for OpenComputers' extended tooltips (default is `Shift`), a print's active state will be shown, if any.

Printed blocks are also Forge MultiPart compatible. If present, multiple prints can be placed into a single block-space, unless they do not collide, and the total number of shapes in the block-space does not exceed the limit for a single model. Due to the nature of Forge MultiPart, prints can therefore also be placed into the same block-space as any other Forge MultiPart compatible block, such as torches, levers, cables or red alloy wires from Project Red, for example.
