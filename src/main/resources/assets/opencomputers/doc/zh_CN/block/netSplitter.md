# Net Splitter

![*.net *.split](oredict:oc:netSplitter)

The net splitter is a device that allows controlling connectivity between subnetworks. Unlike the [relay](relay.md) or [power converter](powerConverter.md) it directly connects adjacent subnetworks, i.e. components can be accessed. Each side's connectivity can be toggled using a wrench (e.g. the [scrench](../item/wrench.md)). When a redstone signal is applied to the net splitter, all sides' connectivity is inverted.

This block can therefore be used to toggle connectivity to certain parts of a component network. Use a [redstone I/O block](redstone.md) or [redstone cards](../item/redstoneCard1.md) to automate the net splitter.
