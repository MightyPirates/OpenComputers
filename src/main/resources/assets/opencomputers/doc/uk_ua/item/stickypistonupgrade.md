# Sticky Piston Upgrade

![Push it. Pull it.](oredict:oc:stickyPistonUpgrade)

The sticky piston upgrade is an upgrade to the [Piston Upgrade](pistonupgrade.md) which allows some devices to act very much like a vanilla sticky piston. When installed, a piston component becomes available. Its methods are `push()` and `pull()`. When these are called the device will act like a vanilla sticky piston and try to push or pull the block in its forward facing direction. For [robots](../block/robot.md) and [microcontrollers](../block/microcontroller.md), this is the front face; for [tablets](tablet.md), it will use the player's facing direction.
