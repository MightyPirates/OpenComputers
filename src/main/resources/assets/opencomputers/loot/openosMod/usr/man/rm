NAME
  rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
  rm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
  Removes all of the specified files, one by one. By default, it does not remove directories. To remove a mount, please use umount.

  If the -I option is given, and there are more than three files or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given, the rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation. If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

  Otherwise, if a file is unwritablle, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file. If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
  Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

  -f, --force
         ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
  
  -i     prompt before every removal
  
  -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively; less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes
  
  --one-file-system
         when removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argument

  --no-preserve-root
         do not treat '/' specially

  --preserve-root
         do not remove '/' (default)

  -r, -R, --recursive
         remove directories and their contents recursively

  -d, --dir
         remove empty directories

  -v, --verbose
         explain what is being done

  --help
         display this help and exit.

By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use this command:
  rm ./-foo

EXAMPLES
  rm a
    Deletes the file `a`.
