NAME
  lua - a simple Lua interpreter

SYNOPSIS
  lua

DESCRIPTION
  Launches a command line that can be used to evaluate Lua statements and expressions. This can be very useful for testing out commands. Note that the interpreter will automatically try to resolve undefined globals using `require`, i.e. it will try to load a package with the specified name.
