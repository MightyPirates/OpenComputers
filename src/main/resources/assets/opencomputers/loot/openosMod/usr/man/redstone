DESCRIPTION
  This program allows manipulating redstone output of the computer via the shell, if it has a built-in redstone card or is connected to a redstone I/O block. It can also be used to just display the current in- and output. If another mod is installed that provides bundled redstone logic, such as RedLogic, MineFactory Reloaded (Rednet Cables) or Project: Red, it can also be used to interact with bundled signals by passing the `-b` flag.

OPTIONS

  redstone north -b lime 200
    Sets the bundled `lime` output of a redstone I/O block's northern side to 200.
