# This file contains the list of floppy disks that can be found as loot.
# Each entry is a mapping of folder name to disk label. Parameters are
# the 'weight' of an item in the random generation process and the color
# of the floppy. The default weight is one. For example, a disk with
# weight 2 is two times as likely to be generated than an item with
# weight 1. Weight 0 means it will not spawn at all.
#The color defaults to gray. It must be a dye's ore-dict name.
