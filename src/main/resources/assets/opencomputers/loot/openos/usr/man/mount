SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
  All files accessible in OpenOS are arranged in one big tree, starting with the root node, '/'. The files are the leaves of the tree, directories are inner nodes of the tree. Files can be distributed across several devices (file system components, such as hard drives and floppies). The `mount` command is used to attach a file system to this tree. The `umount` command can be used to remove a mounted file system from the tree (note that `rm` works for this, too).

EXAMPLES
  mount
    Display a list of all currently mounted file systems.

  mount test /home
    Mounts the file system labeled `test` at `/home`.

  mount 56f /var
    Mounts the file system of which the address starts with `56f` at `/var`.

  mount --readonly tmpfs /tmp_ro
    Mounts a readonly access path of tmpfs to /tmp_ro

  mount --bind /mnt/fa4/home /home
    Mounts /mnt/fa5/home to /home
