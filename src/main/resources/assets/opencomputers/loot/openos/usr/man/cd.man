NAME
  cd - change the current working directory

SYNOPSIS
  cd [directory]
  cd -

DESCRIPTION
  `cd` allows changing the current working directory, i.e the directory based on which relative paths are resolved.

  If no operand is given then HOME environment variable is used.
  
  If the operand is - (just a single dash) then OLDPWD environment variable is used.
  
  Relative path components ./ and ../ may be used to denote the working directory and the parent directory, respectively. An operand starting with ./ is equivalent to PWD environment variable. See examples for illustrations.
  
  Lastly, cd will attempt to change the current directory to the path defined by the operand, reporting errors if any.
  
  If cd is successful, OLDPWD environment variable will also be set to the previous value of PWD (that is the current working directory immediately prior to the call to cd).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
  PWD
    Parent Working Directory, the current working directory

  OLDPWD
    Old PWD, set each time the PWD is changed by calling the cd utility

  HOME
    Represents the path of the user's home directory

EXAMPLES
  cd a
    Changes to directory `a` in the current working directory

  cd /bin
    Changes to directory `/bin`, using the specified absolute path

  cd ../
    Changes to the parent directory of the current working directory

  cd -
    Changes to the previos directory, defined by OLDPWD, and set each time cd changes PWD
