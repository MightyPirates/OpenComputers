NAME
  more - primitive file viewer

SYNOPSIS
  more FILE

DESCRIPTION
  `more` allows viewing the contents of a file one screenful at a time.
  There is no buffering which means you cannot scroll back, long lines will jump the view forward, but there is a small and fixed memory footprint even when piping long running programs with significant output

EXAMPLES
  more /home/a.txt
    Displays the contents of file `/home/a.txt`
