NAME
  ln - creates symbolic links

SYNOPSIS
  ln FILE [TARGET]

DESCRIPTION
  `ln` allows creating virtual symbolic links. A symbolic link is a reference in the file system that can be used to point to other nodes in the file system. For example, a symbolic link to a file will behave like that file: it can be opened and changed, where in reality the file the link references is changed. A symbolic link to a directory will behave as such.

  Note that symbolic links can lead to cycles (recursion) in the file system structure.

  Symbolic links in OpenOS are 'virtual'. They are not stored on any file system, and as such will not persist across a reboot of the computer. This also means that the can be created in virtual folders, and even on read-only file systems.

EXAMPLES
  ln /bin/ls.lua
    Creates a symbolic link `ls.lua` to the file `/bin/ls.lua` in the current working directory.

  ln /home/magic.lua /bin/magic.lua
    Creates a symbolic link to file `/home/magic.lua` in the `/bin` directory.
