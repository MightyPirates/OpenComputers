NAME
  update - update OpenOS files from an OpenOS install disk

SYNOPSIS
  update [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
  Run the install command so that it reinstalls OpenOS from a filesystem labeled "openos". By default this will not change the filesystem label or default boot device, and any existing files in /etc (such as rc.cfg) are not replaced with their defaults.

OPTIONS
  Options are the same as for install and can be used to override update's defaults.

EXAMPLES
  update
    Install OpenOS from the boot filesystem, set the destination as the boot device and label it OpenOS.
