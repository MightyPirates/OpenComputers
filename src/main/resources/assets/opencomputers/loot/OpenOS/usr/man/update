NAME
  update - update OpenOS files from an OpenOS install disk

SYNOPSIS
  update [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
  Run the install command so that it reinstalls OpenOS from a filesystem labeled "openos". By default this will not change the filesystem label or default boot device, and the user is asked before any files are overwritten.

OPTIONS
  Options are the same as for install and can be used to override update's defaults.

EXAMPLES
  update
    Update OpenOS and prompt the user before overwriting files.
